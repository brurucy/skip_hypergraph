# Witchcraft <a href='https://bigdata.cs.ut.ee/'><img src='logo.png' align="right" height="138.5" /></a>

Witchcraft is a library that contains a (small) family of novel, probabilistic, in memory, cheap and easily parallelized, data structures.

Here's some characteristics:

1. O(n) space complexity.
2. The data structures are, **thematically**, named with **incredibly** creative names. `TeleportList` has an interval-tree-like search, while `SplitList` splits its internal sublists in a **very** interesting way.
3. `TeleportList` and `SplitList` make use of `MinMaxList`, which is nothing but an ordered list that provides O(1) access to max and min values.
4. `MaxList` and `MinList` are derivations of `MinMaxList`, that, respectively, do not keep track of min and max, and are, maybe, used as sub levels of the `MinMaxList`.
5. Approximately ~ average O(log n) complexity for search, insert and delete. **TODO** semi-formal complexity reasoning
6. `SkipList`'s geometric-height-sort-of-thing hierarchy is kept.

# Rationale

I wrote this package for you, because things don't excite you anymore.

How many tree-like data structures are out there? ~~more than 8000?(cringy reference I know)~~ I have no idea how many, but, certainly ~~more than we need~~ lots, and, most importantly, you want to try something different, don't you?

This is the right tool for you, if you **really** want to use Skip Lists ~~as long as you don't care about getting the next element in constant time, but let's keep that as a secret~~

So, you might think ü§î, why not just use...Skip Lists?

* **O (n log n) space complexity** ü§¢ that is very bad, SAD!.

* **No one seems to care about it?** there's barely any python skip-list libraries. Depressing. üò≠

* You want a very cheap, and raw üç£, kv-store.

* You think `sortedcontainers` is awesome, but you'd prefer to use something that could benefit from the ~~gorillon~~ many different cores your computer has(at some point, because right now it is single threaded üòç). 

## TODO, in order of importance

* make it a kv store.

* Add delete~~(lol we didn't yet)~~, either as actually deleting an element, or just marking it as deleted.

* Use bloom filters to speed up recurring queries

* Improve the interval search. What's the most efficient way of looking for all intervals that envelop an integer?

at first we really wanted to turn this into a hypergraph problem, but in the end we didn't ü§ô.
